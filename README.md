The goal of this analysis was originally to compete in the ERP Prediction Competition hosted wihtin UCSB's PSTAT Department through Hull Tactical. All credit in creating the dataset belongs to Hull Tactical.

The Department of Statistics & Applied Probability and the Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research are partnering with Hull Tactical to run a data science contest on predicting the S&P 500 returns. 
*More information relating to that competition can be found [here](https://ucsb-erp-contest.herokuapp.com/).*

Credits to Hull Tactical for the dataset provided and UCSB's PSTAT Department for facilitating the competition. 

This project pivoted from a group contest to an personal explaration into using LSTM's.

This project was done using the Python3 Kernel in a Jupyter Notebook.
